					<h2>The Idea</h2>
					<p>As you have seen in the main page of the project, each piece of the collection is a astrophoto
						framed inside what should look like camera objective and rotating.<br />
						Meanwhile, an ambient sound is played on the background, composed by atmospheric pad and a
						"blip" sequence, generated from the star field.</p>
					<p>In this section we want to briefly describe the process for the sound generation. More technical
						details about the whole pipeline can be found directly in the github repository.</p>
					<p>The main idea was to have a sound component generated by the specific image itself. We decided
						then to see if we could "play" the star field, or put in a different way: to use the pattern of
						stars and planets to create a sound.</p>
					<p>After a few small prototypes, we realized that the most "spacey" effect would have been given by
						simple <i>blips</i>, acting as deep space radio signals.</p>
					<h2>The Blips</h2>
					<p>In order to have a pattern to start off with, the photo of the astral object needs to be turned
						into playeable "numbers". We used python and <a
							href="https://docs.opencv.org/master/">OpenCV</a> to achieve this.
					<p>Let's see the flow with an example, M6:</p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/M6.jpg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>Ideally, we would have a low frequency beeping sequence where there are fewer stars and a more
						intense one where field gets denser.<br />
						All this fitting within the 20 seconds length of the video. In order to do this, we needed to
						identify the positions of the stars in the image and then distribute them in their respective
						slot of an imaginary sequencer, playing the stars from left to right.</p>
					<p>First step is to declutter the star field from the noice a "bring forward" the brightest parts
						of the image. This is done in two steps: first turning the image into grey scale
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/grey.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					and then applyint a binary thresholding operation to only keep the brightest spots. Code:
					<pre>
					<code>
gray = cv2.cvtColor(img, cv2.COLOR_BGR2GRAY)
ret, thresh_img = cv2.threshold(gray, 200, 255, cv2.THRESH_BINARY)
					</code>
					</pre>
					Result:
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/thres.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>
						This version of the image can now be used with the OpenCV <code>findContours</code> function to
						identify the boundaries of the stars
					</p>
					<div class="box alt">
						<div class="row gtr-uniform">
							<div class="col-6"><span class="image fit"><img src="images/circles.jpeg" alt="" /></span>
							</div>
						</div>
					</div>
					<p>From this is now possible to know the center position of each identified star and its area.</p>
					<p>We have now turned an image into a list of values. The step from this to generating the sound
						sequence is relatively simple.</p>
					<p>We have used a pre-synthesized blip as a starting sound and pitched it up or down to create lower
						pitch and higher pitch blips.
						This is useful to both make the bigger star blips "deeper" and also to create some variation
						between images.
					</p>
					<h2>Final Touch</h2>
					Given that the pure bliping is not really immersive taken alone, we decided to add some atmospheric
					element to the composition. For this, we resorted to the good old Ableton and some nice atmospheric
					pads that we selected (and edited) from our collection.
					These part is completely manual: one pad is played for each object. 12 notes in a altered chromatic
					scale for each pads, with special pads in C and B for M1 and M110.<br />
					Check the final result on <a
						href="https://opensea.io/assets/0x33c0de6e17862a79a4f7273adf105cf64a356f60/6">Opensea</a>.
					You can find sounds and more details inside the <a
						href="https://github.com/theinnerspace/astrum-nft/">github repository</a>.
					<h2>Last Words</h2>
					More work has been done to make sure we could easily regenerate all videos and sounds easily in case
					we found better pictures or in case of copyright issues. The whole pipeline will be described in a
					later post.
					We hope you found this article interesting. Feel free to drop an email at

					Live long and prosper,
					Inner Space
